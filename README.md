# SneakerUpdate
Simple Python script to update me on the latest sneaker raffles based on a 
given list of websites. This is not a raffle bot!

## Vision

The program will initially run in the terminal with a future implementation 
of a GUI. It will have a config file attached, containing raffle webiste urls 
which will be checked periodically or on user input.

## Supported Websites

* FootShop
* SVD

**The urls.cfg file should only contain links to currently supported sites. 
You can exclude websites by commenting out urls.**
